Windows problem solving

Issue with the web application installed. When browsing to http://localhost/ we get a
503 exception. Please diagnose and solve the issue.

Solution:

1) Tried browsing http://localhost/ - > we get a 503 exception

2) Went to IIS - started restarting -> Default web site - Then checked Application pool then selected DefaultAppPool which is in a stopped state.

3) Then restarted the DefaultAppPoo - > Refreshed the Default web site, still same error exit, again checked Application pool, again DefaultAppPool went to stopped state.

4) Then in the Action Section -> Select Advance setting in Rapid-Fail Protection change Enable is False -> then started DefaultAppPool and restarted my Default web site, still same error exit, but DefaultAppPool is still in running state.

5) Then check Event Viewer -> System Log -> Its thrown Error log - Event 5059,WAS, warning EVENT 5057,WAS

6) Then in Internet Information Services (IIS) Manager then select the Application Pools folder underneath the computer name.

7) In Features View, select the application pool. In the Actions pane, select Advanced Settings.
Under Process Model, verify the Identity type. Then the value is in ApplicationPoolIdentiy then i change it into default NetworkService.

8) Then stop and restarted the Default web site then browse into http://localhost/ and its loading successfully.
