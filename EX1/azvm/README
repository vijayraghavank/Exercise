Hi, i have used terraform to create azure vm

 Install terraform binaries

 install az-cli

Logging into  azure using
$ az login

Use az account set with the subscription ID
$az account set --subscription subscriptionid


Go into folder azvm

$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply 



Once all the resources are created.

To Get Public IP address

$az network public-ip list -g vijay | grep ipAddress

Then ssh into the Vm

$ssh vijay@publicip

ping with private IPs to check the connection between two VMs.
