Linux problem solving

Issue with Redis on this machine. It's not starting. Please diagnose and solve the issue.

Solution:

Steps

1) sudo systemctl status redis -> redis is in failed state

2) Then tried to restart redis -> sudo systemctl restart redis.service

3) Then checked system logs -> journalctl -xe - > got this error 'logfile /var/log/redis-server.log'

4) Then viewed redis.conf file ->  sudo vim /etc/redis/redis.conf

5) Checked the path /var/log/redis-server.log and find out which is not the right path.

6) Then edited the redis.conf file with correct path i.e /var/log/redis/redis-server.log

7) sudo systemctl restart redis.service - > successfully restarted

8) After restarting redis checked redis status -> sudo systemctl status redis

9) Successfully running and redis is in active state
